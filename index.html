			<h2>Right Door</h2>
			<p>Right Door is a Metro route calculator with real-time train arrivals for the departing station. Comments allow users to share tips on where to board in order to be dropped closest to their next escalator. This was my first individual project; it was first built with Sinatra and later reconstructed as I was learning Rails. <a href='https://github.com/emilymcafee/rightdoor'>Visit the code</a> or read about the project on <a href='http://emilymcafee.github.io/2014/12/20/right-door.html'>my blog</a>.</p>

			<h2>TwitterBurst</h2>
			<p>TwitterBurst is a head-to-head, real-time hashtag competition built on Rails. I acted as project lead for this group project. My contributions included implementing the backend architecture, managing group workflow, and building a Node.js app that serves TwitterBurst with a custom Twitter stream for each match. When visiting this app, you may need to also awaken <a href='http://twitter-burst-node.herokuapp.com/'>the Node server</a> that is hosted for free on Heroku! Visit the code (<a href='https://github.com/emilymcafee/t_burst_new'>Rails</a> & <a href='https://github.com/emilymcafee/twitter-burst-node'>Node</a>) or read about the project on my blog.</p>
